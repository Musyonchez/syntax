# Shared Utilities - Simple, Uniform, Consistent

Common code shared across all server functions.

*Simple does not mean "not good" - it means choosing elegant solutions over complex ones.*

## Modules
- `auth.py` - JWT validation
- `database.py` - MongoDB connection
- `utils.py` - Response helpers

**Principle**: Simple = elegant, reusable, excellent utilities.
