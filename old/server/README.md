<!-- Alternatives You might consider (if you want smarter control later):
Token importance weighting:

Prioritize masking based on how essential a token is to understanding logic (e.g., mask return before print).

Harder to implement but makes the quiz more meaningful.

Adaptive masking:

Track which types the user struggles with and increase masking in those areas.

Pattern-based masking:

Use syntactic patterns (e.g., always mask loop keywords in difficulty 7+) instead of pure randomness. -->
