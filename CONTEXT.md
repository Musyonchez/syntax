# SyntaxMem - AI Assistant Context File

## Project Overview
**SyntaxMem** is an interactive coding practice platform where users complete masked code snippets to improve their programming skills. Think of it as "fill-in-the-blanks" for code learning.

### Original Implementation
The project started with a full-stack implementation stored in the `/old/` directory:
- **Client**: Next.js 15 with Apollo GraphQL, Redux, NextAuth
- **Server**: FastAPI with Strawberry GraphQL + SQLite
- **Features**: Code masking, leaderboards, snippet management, Google OAuth

### Current Status: Complete Rebuild
We are rebuilding SyntaxMem from scratch with a modern, scalable architecture:
- **Client**: Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Server**: Google Cloud Functions (FaaS) + Python
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **Deployment**: Vercel (client) + Google Cloud (server)

## Core Concept & Features

### How SyntaxMem Works
1. **Code Masking**: Take programming code and intelligently mask tokens (keywords, operators, etc.)
2. **Practice Mode**: Users fill in the blanks to complete the code
3. **Scoring**: Compare user input with correct answers using similarity algorithms
4. **Leaderboards**: Track user performance and rankings

### Example Workflow
```python
# Original Code
def calculate_total(items):
    return sum(item.price for item in items)

# Masked Version (difficulty 5/10)
def _____(items):
    return ___(item.price ___ item in items)

# User fills in: "calculate_total", "sum", "for"
# System scores based on accuracy and similarity
```

## Core Services

### Code Masking Engine
- **Purpose**: Intelligently mask tokens in code based on difficulty
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript (expandable)
- **Algorithm**: Uses Pygments tokenization to identify keywords, operators, punctuation
- **Difficulty Scaling**: 1-10 scale affects probability of masking (10% to 100%)
- **Preservation**: Maintains imports, comments, and code structure

### Similarity Scoring
- **Purpose**: Compare user answers with correct solutions
- **Algorithm**: String similarity with fuzzy matching
- **Scoring**: Weighted by token importance and user response time
- **Feedback**: Detailed mistake analysis for learning

### Progress Tracking
- **Scope**: Official snippets only (personal snippets don't affect rankings)
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, speed, consistency, improvement over time
- **Achievements**: Badges for milestones, streaks, language mastery

## Important Notes for AI Assistants

### When Working on This Project
1. **Always prioritize MVP features** over advanced enhancements
2. **Maintain the dual snippet system** - official vs personal is crucial
3. **Leaderboard only tracks official snippets** - this is a key business rule
4. **Forum is for dev-user communication** - not general user discussion
5. **Focus on code quality and user experience** over feature quantity
